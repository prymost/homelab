A list of things i want to do in this project.
I do not want to be dependent on GitHub issues for tracking my tasks. At least not yet.
Once a TODO is complete, I will delete it from this list and record it in the [changelog](./CHANGELOG.md).

- Go over security checklist for k8s: https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/administer-cluster/securing-a-cluster/
- Run something tha checks cluster security regularly (like kube-bench)
- Set up github actions to do automatic security checks on my manifests

- Things i want in my homelab:
    - Monitoring solution (Grafana + Prometheus?)
    - Minecraft server
    - Jellyfin? (Media server)
    - Homarr/Homepage? (Dashboard)
    - Caliber-web? (Ebook management)

- Data persistence strategy
    - Long term: NAS (Synology)
    - Short term: Bind mounts to host machine
