A list of things i want to do in this project.
I do not want to be dependent on GitHub issues for tracking my tasks. At least not yet.
Once a TODO is complete, I will delete it from this list and record it in the [changelog](./CHANGELOG.md).

    - Jellyfin? (Media server)
    - Homarr/Homepage? (Dashboard)
