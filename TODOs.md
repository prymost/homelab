A list of things i want to do in this project.
I do not want to be dependent on GitHub issues for tracking my tasks. At least not yet.
Once a TODO is complete, I will delete it from this list and record it in the [changelog](./CHANGELOG.md).

- Update README with devcontainer instructions
- Create a setup script for setting the homelab up with k3s
- Things i want in my homelab:
    - Mealie for meal planning
    - Some monitoring solution (Grafana + Prometheus?)
    - Minecraft server
    - Jellyfin? (Media server)
    - Homarr/Homepage? (Dashboard)
    - Caliber-web? (Ebook management)
